# ProgrammingforChemistsProject
The project offers a machine learning model for predicting the lipophilicity of a molecule

The original dataset can be found at the link below:

-DATASET: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tWtzQwqUZ2chtdIJ2eQWzsA5181yzqFX/view?usp=sharing

You can find the file predobr.py in the folder, which contains code for the primary cleaning of the dataset, deletion, and filling in empty descriptor values using the RDKit library.

The Nikita_D folder contains a visualization of the data set that was used to train the model.

The "Nikita_M" folder contains the "pipeline_catboostreg" file and two processed datasets that were obtained from the source. The code implements a regression model that includes training, searching for the best features, and retraining with regularization.
